<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>

<p>Hey guys, I am Jiovana Arzate. I am from El Paso, Texas and graduated from Franklin High School. I am a first-year student in the Red McCombs School of Business, and though I am undeclared currently, I am planning to major in Accounting. I am also considering a minor or certificate in International Business. I love to listen to all types of music, and listen to most genres. I like to cook and play around with makeup in my free time. <br /><br /></p>

<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
