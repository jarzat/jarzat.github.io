<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Hey guys, my name is Jiovana Arzate. I am from El Paso, Texas and graduated from Franklin High School. I am a first-year student in the Red McCombs School of Business. Though I am currently undeclared, I hope and plan to major in Accounting. I am also considering a minor or certificate in International Business.<br /><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I like to listen to all types and genres of music, but I mostly listen to hip hop and R&B. It also usually depends on my mood and what I am doing at that moment when I'm deciding what to listen to. I take joy in discovering new music, as it is exciting to find new (new to me at least) artists. Recently, I have been listening to Nao and Summer Walker.</p>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
